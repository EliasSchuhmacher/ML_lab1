## Lab 1 - Air Quality Prediction Service
by Elias Schuhmacher & Markus Ledung

1. Write a backfill feature pipeline that downloads historical weather data (ideally >1
year of data), loads a csv file with historical air quality data (downloaded from
https://aqicn.org) and registers them as 2 Feature Groups with Hopsworks.

2. Schedule a daily feature pipeline notebook that downloads yesterdayâ€™s weather
data and air quality data, and also the weather prediction for the next 7-10 days
and update the Feature Groups in Hopsworks. Use GH Actions or Modal.

3. Write a training pipeline that (1) selects the features for use in a feature view,
reads training data with the Feature View, trains a regression or classifier model to
predict air quality (pm25). Register the model with Hopsworks.

4. Write a batch inference pipeline that creates a dashboard. The program should
download your model from Hopsworks and plot a dashboard that predicts the air
quality for the next 7-10 days for your chosen air quality sensor.

5. Monitor the accuracy of your predictions by plotting a hindcast graph showing
your predictions vs outcomes (measured air quality).

6. Update your Model by adding a new feature, lagged air quality for the previous 1-3
days.
